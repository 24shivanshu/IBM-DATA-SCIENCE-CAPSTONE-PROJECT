    "I have been looking for an opportunity to work for a leading firm in Manhattan, NY. I am very excited and I want to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera in order to answer relevant questions arisen. The key question is : How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place in New York?\n",

    "Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n",

    "desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius\n",
    "top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n",

    "as a reference.\n",
    "Business Problem:\n",

    "Interested Audience\n",
    "I believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone moving to other large city in US, EU or Asia. The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills."
